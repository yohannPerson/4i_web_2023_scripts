Tight schedule per externally imposed goal posts. The in-house software team from Panama was planning to stay extended periods in Taiwan where the hardware development was centered; as the COVID19 pandemic hit the global human society in the middle of the project, it seemed questionable to fly all the company people back to Taiwan from their Christmas and New Year vacation as it looked like Taiwan was a danger zone due to its close proximity and tight ties with China.
