"Specs and Speed","Most of our clients have a general idea of what their requirements are for their software. In some cases, they have a very clear idea of what they want.

However, when executing a project, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification"">hundreds if not thousands of details need to be defined</a>. It is close to impossible for a non-professional to do so upfront, as one will tend to overlook most of the questions. But even for a professional, it is very difficult to produce a coherent spec sheet upfront: we noticed that almost all the spec sheets we receive have numerous internal contradictions or omissions, making it impossible to actually execute the project without minor or sometimes even major revisions.

In the next installment of <a href=""https://4idps.com/insights/"">4i Insights</a>, we will describe some tools to improve the process of writing specs. At the moment, please remember this: the better the specs, the faster a project can be executed. Better specs=faster speed!

&nbsp;","Project Management|Software Development|Specs",https://4idps.com/specs-and-speed/
Prototyping,"Creating a prototype is a great tool for writing good specs, as it creates a visual and tactile interface that makes the product self-explanatory. In addition, we have often experienced that clients’ ideas on what their software is supposed to achieve are well-aligned, while design is more subjective, and can create disagreements. It is best for such disagreements to be resolved at the start of the project, rather than at the end. Prototyping is a great way to make sure that the discussions are efficient, and it forces the discussion on many aspects of the specs which one might not think about without a prototype.

It is much cheaper and less time consuming to fiddle around on a prototype, rather than on a fully developed software product with an integrated and often complex backend.

Some online tools allow for wireframing as well as fully fledged design. The tools we use most are <a href=""https://zeplin.io"">Zeplin</a>, <a href=""https://www.invisionapp.com"">InVision</a>, <a href=""https://www.sketch.com/docs/prototyping/"">Sketch</a>, and <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/tw/creativecloud/buy/students.html?sdid=RBS7NL5Y&amp;mv=search&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwqp-LBhDQARIsAO0a6aIPShdUIyq6G7euDKL9DzthsZayQqq_RQ_vV6BiOBZ-UDLf3_-0oWQaAlhcEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!541624032915!b!!g!!adobe%20photoshop%20student%20download!14398435821!126039577563"">Photoshop</a>. All have their respective advantages and drawbacks, and we use them for different scenarios . Some can be integrated with each other to some extent.

Are you interested in explaining in more detail which tool we use in which case, and why? If so, please <a href=""https://4idps.com/contact/"">let us know</a>, and we will address it in a future newsletter.

In the next issue of Insights, we will address our favourite collaboration tools for software development. Please stay tuned!

"Notes on planning your software resources","Software is always-changing and always under development. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word"">Microsoft word</a> for instance has had a new release every 2-3 years since its inception in 1984, with multiple bug fixes in-between.

So, you need a good resource plan to match your development roadmap. How to do that?

– First and foremost, make sure that someone inside or outside of your company knows how the various parts of the software work together. You want your resources to spend a majority of their time improving your software, and not just on understanding what their predecessor(s) have done. Depending on the technology used and the development process, handing over software to new developers can be time-consuming.

– Secondly, be sure to have a good plan for your development needs, and a good bug reporting system. There are many bug report systems out there for the different needs companies may have, and we have used many of them – let us know if you would like us to point you in the right direction.

– Lastly: discuss the development plan and bug database with your in-house or outsourced development team. If the needs are well-defined, it should be easy for them to estimate the resource needs.

"A brief history of software","<span lang=""EN-US"">Let’s start recapitulate the history of software:</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">-  </span><span lang=""EN-US"">There are many precursors to modern software. Some concepts such as the abacus (possibly as early as 5,000 years ago) are very ancient, but the first algorithm was devised in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by Charles Babbage / Ada Lovelace. However this was purely theoretical.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">-  </span><span lang=""EN-US"">In 1935 Alan Turing wrote the first theory of software, and the first electronic computer, the ENIAC, came into existence in 1946, and was used to calculate artillery firing tables for the US army.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">-  </span><span lang=""EN-US"">From 1948 to 1979, various binary codes were developed to perform calculations, and the programming languages Fortran, COBOL and BASIC were developed. The Apollo mission was the first endeavor that depended on software for practical and complex tasks.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">-  </span><span lang=""EN-US"">From the 1960’s onwards, minicomputers started to be sold. They were essentially miniaturized mainframes, and came with pre-installed software. Most of the software was stored on cassette tapes and cartridges.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">-  </span><span lang=""EN-US"">From the 1980’s to early 2000’s, PC’s came into wider use, with the industry dominated first by Apple and then IBM.</span>

&nbsp;

<u><span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, the computer industry started in 1976</span></u><span lang=""EN-US"">, driven by the local production prowess, and affinity to technology. The expertise grew fast, with Taiwan quickly becoming a critical element in the international supply chains.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">The 1980’s and 90’s saw the emergence of Taiwan’s semiconductors industry, which necessitated advanced researchers to develop the coming generations of microchips.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">The emergence of Taiwan’s large-scale software industry started in the 1990’s but really took off around 2010, which is incidentally the year in which 4i DPS was founded.</span>

<u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Taiwan is now such a critical element of the semiconductors industry that the New York Times recently called it “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/opinion/taiwan-computer-chips.html"">pound for pound the most important place in the world</a>”. It has both hardware and software capabilities that are unmatched by any other territory that small.</b></span></u>

<span lang=""EN-US"">People have different interpretations of the facts, and whether what happened was justified or sensible. This discussion will likely continue for a while.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">This much is clear: the loss of access to the portals has an immense impact on the people whom it concerns. It means the disappearance of their public personhood.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">What's the solution?</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">It's actually very simple: everyone should be on more than one portal. Just like we should read more than one newspaper, and consider more than one car brand.

"Can technology make elections more transparent?","<h2>Election Technology<br><br><a href=""https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/democracy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Elections are at the core of democracy</a>, and&nbsp;having had the opportunity to work on an international election project in early 2020, here are some insights into the technological landscape.</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Voting technology</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>Typically each territory has its own laws governing election equipment, and the voting equipment has to be customized to those laws. The equipment can have various functionalities, such as counting ballots, checking ID’s and biometrical data, issuing voting receipts, etc. In some territories, the customization has to take place on short notice, since the selection of the supplier happens shortly before the election takes place. Therefore, some large vendors of voting equipment essentially consist of teams of engineers with knowledge of voting technology, and production facilities for voting equipment; and each election is a project, in which the modules are assembled and customized to fit the project.</p>
<h2>Elections could become virtual events in the future<br>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In the future, as we start to increasingly use our digital persona, elections could become purely virtual events. After all, some territories already encourage digital tax filing, payments, digital signatures etc. – it is not a big step to imagine some territories advocating purely digital elections, possibly in combination with limited in-person voting opportunities.</p>
<h2>Digital voting advantages<p></p>
</h2>
If it is done properly, digital voting has big advantages: for instance, voters can be given sole access to their (encrypted) voting record on the voting database, thus being able to verify if their vote has been counted.
<p>The voter database can be audited easily: it would contain the information about who voted, while the vote itself is only accessible by the voter for verification purposes.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Decentralisation</h2>
<p></p>
The <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Blockchain’s</a> decentralized nature lends itself as a technology for elections, although various approaches are possible, with or without a blockchain component. Several large corporations, for instance, Microsoft, have developed their own approaches; at the moment the largest impediment to the introduction appears to be not technology, but the will of the political system to go ahead.
&nbsp;
As a Taiwan-Swiss company, we are particularly interested in the subject of voting and keep abreast of the developments in this field.

"Make sure that you have a sound software maintenance plan","<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Software maintenance</strong></span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">Software is not static; it works on a server environment, communicates with other pieces of software, and is subject to new requirements from its users or legislators. In addition, some of your software’s components may themselves undergo updates, or may no longer be supported.</span><span lang=""EN-US"">
</span>

<b><u><span lang=""EN-US"">Please make sure that you have a person responsible for maintaining your software at all times.</span></u></b><span lang=""EN-US"">
</span>

<u><span lang=""EN-US"">How do you find / appoint that person or company?</span></u>

<span lang=""EN-US"">1) One efficient way is to get the entity which developed your software, to maintain it. The average app contains more than 50,000 lines of code, and it takes time for a new entity to understand how it all fits together! However, in the medium term, you will probably need to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance"">appoint a new entity</a>, due to personnel, availability or other changes.</span><span lang=""EN-US"">
</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">2) If a new entity is to maintain your software, please plan ahead, as it could take up to a month or more for a new person to understand the code base and be able to make new commits on it.</span><span lang=""EN-US"">
</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">3) Make sure to have a thorough documentation of your software!</span><span lang=""EN-US"">
</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">4) Be careful if the entity assigned to maintain your software proposes to redevelop it from scratch instead: redevelopments tend to take longer than anticipated, plus you may run into the same problem again later, if a new entity has to take over. Refactoring could be a better option; we will write more about this in a future newsletter.</span>

"Work in the age of Corona","In the age of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"">Corona</a>, remote work has become increasingly popular, and even a necessity.
<div>Most people assume that since programming is done in front of a computer, and Engineers aren’t always the most communicative people anyway :), development is quasi predestined for remote work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, working in an office does have advantages:</div>
<div>-  It’s convenient for employees to have a workstation in the office, without having to reserve space at home for their work.</div>
<div>-  It’s convenient for project managers to be able to “gather their troops” every morning for the daily standup meeting, without having to deal with communication issues (yes, not everyone has a perfect connection 24/7 in their house).</div>
<div>-  It’s convenient for all of us to visually see who is here and who isn’t, without having to click into a communication software.</div>
<div>-  It’s convenient for everyone to be able to discuss any issue with their colleague without delay (engineers don’t constantly have their communication tools in front of them) – the ability to discuss an issue “here and now” can end up in efficiency savings.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Convenience” here doesn’t just mean “comfort”: convenience can result in lower bug rates, faster development time, and better resources alignment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our conclusion: we find a mix of in-office work and work from home ideal. Sometimes it is best for engineers to work from home for a day, so they aren’t disturbed by their colleagues, and can focus on solving some very hairy issues. But much of the time, it’s still more efficient to work from the office (as long as that is possible). This will also apply to your <a href=""https://4idps.com/solutions/"">outsourced team</a> with us.</div>","Outsourced Team|Software Development",https://4idps.com/work-in-the-age-of-corona/

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Define the specs<br></h2>
<br>
<p>What is to be achieved? Do you just want more clarity in your sales team, or do you want to automate processes? Which ones? What integrations with other software systems are necessary? What statistics do you need? Who will be the users, and how will each of them use it? What additional benefits would you like to get in the future? Can salesforce replace existing company processes (other than sales), and what would be the benefits?<br><br>Having good specs is of critical importance for planning and staffing the project and for a successful <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/"">Salesforce</a> implementation.<br><br>Our consultants can work with you on defining the specs, as you may need someone with a good knowledge of salesforce to guide you through the system and to understand what is possible and what is not. As a matter of fact, the first point of contact with our clients is often the specs definition, which typically takes just a few days or weeks, depending on the complexity of the installation, the people involved, and how familiar you are with software tools in sales management.</p>
<h2>2. Set up your in-house Salesforce team</h2>
<br>
<p>Setting up your in-house team should consist in the following functions:</p>
<p><img src=""https://4idps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.53.44-AM-159x300.png"" alt=""Executive sponsor"" width=""159"" height=""300""> <img src=""https://4idps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.54.16-AM-158x300.png"" alt=""Project Manager"" width=""158"" height=""300""> <img src=""https://4idps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.54.45-AM-159x300.png"" alt=""System Administrator"" width=""159"" height=""300""></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><br></h2>
<h2>3. Locate and prepare the data that is to be migrated to Salesforce</h2>
<br>
<p>Data migration is very important so as not to lose your client history, and depending on the existing formats, this can be simple, or a time-consuming endeavor; so it is important to assess this early on.</p>
<h2>4. Proceed with the implementation</h2>
<br>
<p><a href=""https://4idps.com/contact/"">Our consultants</a> will be in the lead, but regular discussions will be necessary to make sure that the system is configured to your full satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Train users</p>
<p>Salesforce is a very powerful platform, but it is critical that it is used correctly in order to avoid data confusion. Our standard installation contains a training module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. Think of the maintenance early</p>
<p>You may want to change your setup as you use salesforce, and/or need continued training (for instance if you have new employees). Salesforce also has new releases from time to time, which sometimes come with new functionalities that may be useful to you. It is best to have a regular maintenance contract in place right from the start, so as to assure that you are informed early of any observations our consultant may have for you.<br><br>Our regular maintenance contracts contain a once-yearly audit, in which we check how you use the system, and produce a checklist of improvement suggestions.</p>

"Our Philosophy","<h2>Why do we develop and install software?</h2>
<h5 class=""font_5""><span class=""color_22"">We are passionate about automating software processes. Automated processes decrease error rates and down times, and allow process owners to concentrate on the goals they want to achieve, instead of QA. We like to set such systems up, and learn from each case we are given the chance to execute.</span></h5>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">We like software to work constantly, like a Swiss clock. In order to optimize the processes, we like to immerse ourselves into the software environments of our clients, and figure out how things could be improved. Our consultants have a wide range of experiences, both in terms of programming languages and modules, so they can quickly get a grasp of the situation and propose improvements. We like to assure that everything works together seamlessly, so that information is available anytime.</span></p>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""wixGuard"">​</span><span class=""color_22"">In terms of development, we like to work with standard software modules wherever sensible, as this simplifies maintenance. We prefer cloud solutions. For this reason, we are a partner of salesforce CRM and Netsuite ERP.</span></p>

<h2>Our unique selling position</h2>
<h5 class=""font_5"">Our highly trained developers can compete with the best in the world! Consequently, the quality of our software development projects is on par with the highest international standards.</h5>
<h6 class=""font_6"">However, the costs are a fraction of equivalent developments executed in silicon valley and on par with low-cost Asian developer teams, but of significantly higher quality.</h6>
<p class=""font_7"">Our engineers specialize in mobile and app development, and have also developed several back-end integration tools, social media and streaming media sites. We are experienced in all common programming languages such as Java, PHP, .NET, html5, and cloud technology.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">Our software modules have won several prices. Being our own client, we understand what our clients expect.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">When we develop software, we act as if we were the end-user, and do extensive internal quality control before delivering the product to our client. This means that whatever we deliver to you will have been fully tested, saving you a lot of time, and assuring that the product is ready to be rolled out immediately.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">We also take extensive precautions to assure that all aspects of the software you develop with us are kept strictly confidential.</p>

"Why should you get your software developed in Taiwan?","<h2 class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">Why should you get your software developed in Taiwan?
</span></h2>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">
Following its rapid development as a production center for hardware in the 1990's, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"">Taiwan's</a> transformation into a hotbed of software development is less well known. Engineering is the most popular major with over a quarter of all Bachelor's degrees; within this, Information Technology is now the second-most popular one, with over 30,ooo graduates a year. The high standards of Taiwan's technical education system, are further highlighted by its ranking in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) average math scores for 15-year-olds, in which Taiwan consistently ranks in the top 5 in the world.</span></p>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">The transformation from hardware to software Engineering was a natural evolution for the people of Taiwan, who are very attuned to technology and embrace it. Taiwan has one of the highest <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/966613/taiwan-social-media-use-by-platform/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">social media penetration</a> in the world, along with the world’s highest internet penetration rates and internet connection speeds. Its long history as a leading technological powerhouse means that technical processes and mindsets have become second nature for the people here. Unlike other Asian economies in which many industries compete for the best graduates, the large majority of the brightest graduates here are very likely to end up in engineering jobs.</span><span class=""color_22""><span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></span></p>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">Many outsiders continue to be surprised at the fast adoption of new technologies in Taiwan – for instance by the fact that Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment in more than 3,000 Family Mart convenience stores plus many other locations since 2015, in the process turning Taiwan into a Bitcoin destination. But locals know the main reason behind this – many of the world’s best Bitcoin programmers are actually in Taiwan!</span></p>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">Compared with other traditional software outsourcing destinations such as India and China, Taiwan benefits from a far higher level of work ethics, unencumbered worldwide internet access, and a very fast, can-do attitude to software development.</span></p>
<p class=""font_7""><span class=""color_22"">Taiwan has a long way to go as a software center.</span></p>

"Happy New Year of the Metaverse!","In 2022 everything is new! While the good things that happened in 2021 have been welcome to the new year, none of the bad things have. Isn’t that a superpower?

One of the good things that I have transitioned over is virtual spaces. While I used to be able to have 3 in-person meetings a day max., I am now able to have 8 or more, without the anguish of traffic jams, bad weather or other imponderables. This allows me to catch up with people easily, to reconnect with friends around the world, to have meaningful discussions with people who are physically somewhere else. It’s not just about productivity, it is about being able to have a natural discussion with people who are somewhere else. I like it.

An even more exciting extension of this is the Metaverse. In the metaverse I can interact with friends and make new acquaintances, but also play games, visit art museums, and visit virtual cities as they are being built. It’s so exciting because it’s new and it is being built in front of our very eyes. I feel privileged to be able to follow it up close, for instance playing the Sandbox using my alpha pass. There will be critics and detractors of this and other new developments, but the space will keep growing because everyone wants it to. It is full of positivity, it is fun and serves a useful purpose. It’s not a coincidence that many of the largest companies are embracing it. It is no longer just the future, it is becoming the present: The Sandbox, which started building its metaverse 3 years earlier than for instance Facebook, generated gross merchandise volume of US$ 70 M in the first WEEK of December alone, and raised US$ 93 M in October in a round led by Softbank.

We at 4i are supporting some of our clients' journeys in the metaverse.",Metaverse,https://4idps.com/metaverse/
"Government surveillance in times of COVID","<h2>Government surveillance in times of COVID</h2>
During the COVID crisis, a lot has been said about the invasion of privacy and imposing lockdowns in many countries around the world. It is a real problem if the people who control Governments have the ability to check if their laws are enforced at a granular and individual level, so the concern is justified.

<b></b>It is important to separate practical and theoretical discussions. My basic framework is that

<i>“If a technology exists and is useful, someone somewhere will definitely use it. So you should spend time thinking about what the consequences will be, and how you want to position yourself considering the new tech, as opposed to wondering about theoretical issues”</i>

For instance, when the steam engine was invented, people had a lot of thoughts about this new tech. Some ignored it, some wished that it would disappear. Others took advantage of it. The same happened with electric lights, telephones, smartphones, E-mail, etc. The same has been happening with your data for the past 10+ years, including medical and spending patterns.

<b>So the question is: how do we position ourselves to take advantage of this fact, and how do we avoid all becoming slaves to Governments worldwide?</b>

My take is that data transparency works both ways: Governments have a lot more data about their citizens than before. But the citizens also have a lot more data about their Governments than before. In democracies, it is our duty, as citizens, to look at this data and be informed about what our Governments do. If we do that effectively, and our Governments are therefore held accountable, this restricts their ability to use our own information against us. So everyone wins: Governments win because they are accountable for their actions, and citizens win because by checking how their data is used, they can assure it is not used against them in a nefarious way. And society progresses and improves.

Once again, technology helps us in our daily lives.","Data transparency",https://4idps.com/covid-19-data-transparency/
"Custom software development - Examples and Best Practices","During the pandemic, many industries have progressively introduced digital transformation in response to changing consumer behavior toward the online channel. Businesses that have embraced digital transformation have found that it not only improves the process but also reduces the cost of doing business.

In this article, we would share with you the custom software development examples which have resulted in driving success in the digital transforming world, and the reasons why Taiwan can be your best destination for outsourcing Software.
<h2>What is custom software development?</h2>
<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/topics/custom-software-development"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Custom software development</a> is the process of designing, creating, deploying, and maintaining software for a specific set of users, functions, or organizations.
<h2>Examples of custom software development</h2>
Customized software development is widely applied in a range of industry fields. We have selected the following examples that were built by 4i Tech and have made the product successful with the company.
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Fintech
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">The fintech industry uses a wide array of new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to reduce labor costs and improve service processes. Our client hopes to automate the credit application process through customized software, and by incorporating machine learning to automate the credit scoring process.</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">Solutions: An app was developed for applicants to apply for credits, upload their application data and documents, and follow up on the status of their application. We also integrated a third-party machine learning API that ranks the likelihood of success of the applications on certain metrics and helps our client speed up the service process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Smart Home
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">Hardware integration is another common custom software development case. Our client is in the IoT industry and was looking for building an app to control the connected devices at home and had the APP integrated with the hardware protocols.</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">Solution: 4i Tech has developed a customized APP that enables the user to keep track of the status of their devices and control them, turn devices on and off and check the temperature, humidity, etc. The app was developed to the client's specifications and works to the client's full satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Video streaming platform
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">Digital transformation in the video streaming industry evolves rapidly. Our client is a well-known video and audio streaming manufacturer looking to bring-in multi-tenancy technology to have the same program components shared in a multi-user environment.</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">With the built of multitenant architecture, multiple users are able to access from the same platform, and makes it possible to maximize resource and reduce operating costs in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of custom software development?</h2>
Customized software can better meet the business needs than packaged software, and adjust to the business model when needed. It is true that software is the core of driving the organization to adopt digital transformation and deliver value to its customers. If you are looking for a software services provider for your business, below are some considerations you might look into:
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Technical capabilities - From programming languages, and frameworks, to front-end/back-end tools, working with a full-stack development team can help businesses adapt quickly based on project needs.</li>
 	<li>Area of expertise - Usually a company with more industrial experience can rapidly understand the industrial pain point and speed up the development process.</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Talent and quality engineers - Make sure the engineers are skilled and experienced to ensure the highest quality of work is delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will Offshore outsourcing be the right fit for you?</h2>
With the growing demand for software development, more and more companies are turning to offshore outsourcing and aim for cutting development costs and increase productivity. Taiwan is among Asia's top destinations for offshore outsourcing. Here are a couple of reasons why:
<ul>
 	<li>Highly educated talent
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""3"">Every year, more than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_education_in_Taiwan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">25% of Taiwanese have a bachelor's degree</a> in engineering, providing businesses an opportunity to leverage top talent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Thriving IT Market
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""2"">Taiwan has a reputation for technological innovation. Big tech companies like <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2018/04/04/why-google-ibm-and-microsoft-all-decided-to-expand-in-taiwan-this-year/?sh=1324f82e5c72"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Microsoft, IBM, and Google </a>had already expanded their presence to Taiwan and built data centers to be located in East Asia. It also shows the potential for Taiwan to become the next information technology network hub.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Advanced in internet infrastructure
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""2"">The advantageous geographical location between east and southeast Asia has made Taiwan become an important center for submarine communication cables, and greatly supports the key growth of Taiwan's reliance on the IT industry.</li>
